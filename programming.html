    I’ve been working with Python since my first year at University in a variety of projects. 
    Perhaps most significant is my Masters project, which chiefly used NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. 
    Custom functions were designed for cross-correlation and data and outlier handling, as well as linear regression and ensemble sampling.</div>

    Since graduating I’ve been spending more and more time programming recreationally – I am self taught in several clustering and 
    classification algorithms, including k-means and logistic regression, as well as data handling in Pandas. 
    Recently I’ve been using Raspberry Pis to try and teach myself cluster computing!</div>
    
    <div class="infobox"><img src="/static/images/web/6.png" alt="Credit: SQL Server" height=100% class="left"> 
    I’ve spent the past few months improving in other languages – SQL is something new to me that I’m enjoying getting the hang of! 
    This website was written by me in a mixture of HTML, CSS and Python – I’m new to the first two, so managing this in the span of 
    a weekend was quite a fun task!</div>

    I spent two consecutive summers in the UoS Astronomy Group as an intern working on a data reduction pipeline for VEILS. 
    This work was done in IDL, a language I find quite similar to Python, and included an exposure to machine learning and a decent amount 
    of parallel programming.
