    I graduated from The University of Southampton in 2020 with First Class Honours. It was an absolutely fantastic chapter of my 
    life and I loved every minute! Work-wise my modules ranged from cosmological theory, to practical lab and 
    programming work, to abstract mathematics of quantum physics and beyond!</div>

    My grade average at Southampton steadily increased year after year. In my second year my grades were high enough 
    for me to be selected for a module in Tenerife, which involved both a telescope 
    design component with students from other universities and a self-led observation project at the Observatorio del Teide!</div>

    My Masters project involved dust reverberation mapping in Type I AGN; a project involving a 
    hefty amount of research, teamwork, and Python programming. It was incredibly fun and, requiring 
    a combination of linear regression and ensemble sampling, set me off on the path of self-study regarding machine learning techniques.</div>

    My primary interests in astronomy involve galaxies – AGN, star formation regions, and evolution, having studied these 
    topics for my Masters, Tenerife project, and third-year dissertation respectively. 
    I also really enjoyed the cosmology modules taken in my final year, which combined mathematics and astronomical theory.</div>
