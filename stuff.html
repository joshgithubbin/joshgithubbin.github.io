    Currently I work as a risk analyst for Nationwide, where I monitor and develop scorecards used in customer product 
    applications such as credit cards and current accounts. The job involves a lot of data analysis techniques (including 
    machine learning) and communicating with my peers in various ways including papers and presentations.</div>

    In my spare time I have been working on a series of literature reviews regarding the history of pre-telescopic astronomy to gain a
    better understanding of humanity's interest in the sky. Currently I'm editing the first review, which examines evidence of basic 
    astronomical advancement in ancient Afro-Eurasia.

    I still revisit physics theory when I find the time - I like revisiting the modules I found particularly challenging to 
    make sure the knowledge I developed remains sharp. I develop skills in lots of other ways through my hobbies; taking a 
    look on my GitHub should give you a small idea of the other stuff I get up to on slow days!</div>

    All in all I think it's pretty hard to sum myself up in a website - if you have any questions about who I am or what I'm 
    doing, shoot me an email via the address below! I'm always happy to chat and talk about my work and hobbies, or take 
    criticism if you spot a problem!
