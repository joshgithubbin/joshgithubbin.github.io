    My Masters project required two pieces of written work; a paper for experts, detailing every aspect of the project; 
    and a short two-page summary for those with no experience in astronomy. Both were received positively by their respective audiences 
    and were awarded a high grade.</div>

    My third-year dissertation was a literature review detailing the evolution of galaxies. While I am currently working on an updated 
    edition to better reflect my current knowledge of the topic it holds a special place in my heart for being the piece of work that really 
    convinced me of my love of galaxies.</div>

    My latest piece regarding physics (and last piece of work I submitted for my degree) examines the solar wind and its influence on 
    the magnetospheres of the Earth and Moon. While I hadn’t studied space plasma physics before this module I found it an incredibly 
    interesting topic!</div>

    Fiction writing was always something I wanted to go into when I was younger, and the time I spend on it as a casual hobby 
    thankfully makes writing reports and literature reviews something I find pretty fun! For the past several years I’ve 
    taken part in NaNoWriMo, which encourages you to write 50,000 words in a single month.
